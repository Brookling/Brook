## ABOUT
Hello! I'm Brookling.

I’ve been playing _Balatro_ since its release in February 2024. I mainly focus on Gold stake win streaks,  
with a PB of 18 on the Blue Deck.

From February to August 2025, I worked on creating a high-quality vanilla-like mod.  I was inspired by  
many existing mods (which I’ll recommend later) and designed 15 new Jokers with diverse and unique  
abilities. I also spent a lot of time balancing and illustrating them.

Big thanks to Baimao for coding and to everyone who supported the project. Brook is now released—enjoy!
